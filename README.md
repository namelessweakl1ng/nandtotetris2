# nandtotetris2

This repository contains my solutions and work for the **Nand to Tetris course (Part I & Part II)**  
(*From NAND to Tetris – Building a Modern Computer from First Principles*).

In this course, the goal is to build a complete computer system from the ground up, starting from basic logic gates and progressing to a high-level programming language and operating system.

---

## Course Overview

The Nand to Tetris course guides students through building a complete computer system in two main parts:

### Part I – Hardware

Focus areas:
- Boolean logic
- Combinational chips
- Sequential chips
- Memory units
- CPU architecture
- Computer construction
- Assembler

All designs are tested using the official Hardware Simulator.

---

### Part II – Software

Focus areas:
- Virtual Machine (VM) Translator
- Compiler
- Operating System
- High-level programs running on the Hack computer

Projects in this part involve building software tools that translate high-level code into machine language.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder:

- **project1** – Boolean Logic  
- **project2** – Boolean Arithmetic  
- **project3** – Sequential Logic  
- **project4** – Machine Language  
- **project5** – Computer Architecture  
- **project6** – Assembler  
- **project7** – VM Translator (Stack Arithmetic)  
- **project8** – VM Translator (Program Control)  
- **project9** – High-Level Programs  
- **project10** – Compiler (Syntax Analysis)  
- **project11** – Compiler (Code Generation)  
- **project12** – Operating System  

---

## Tools Used

- Nand to Tetris Hardware Simulator  
- Nand to Tetris Software Suite  
- HDL (Hardware Description Language)  
- Hack Assembly Language  

---

## How to Run the Projects

1. Download the **Nand to Tetris software tools** from the official website.  
2. Open the appropriate simulator (Hardware Simulator, CPU Emulator, or VM Emulator).  
3. Load the corresponding project files.  
4. Run the provided test scripts (`.tst`) to verify correctness.

## Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I learned:

- How logic gates combine to form complex circuits  
- How CPUs and memory systems work internally  
- How assembly language interacts with hardware  
- How virtual machines and compilers work  
- How high-level programs are translated into machine code
